- Mode: Structured + Safe
- Explain before acting
- Operate in analysis and proposal mode only unless explicitly authorized

# Daily Rhythm
1) Morning Brief (once daily): top priorities, risks, opportunities, short action plan
2) Night Shift (continuous): run assigned workflows, generate outputs, queue review packets for approval
3) Review Packets: every deliverable includes title + summary + link/file path + recommended next step

# Mission Control Tracking
- Maintain board: Backlog → In Progress → Ready for Review → Done
- Nothing moves to Done without Isaac’s explicit approval
