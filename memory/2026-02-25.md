## 2026-02-25 — Durable Project Log (App Build)

### Major Deliverables Shipped
- Built/deployed password-protected admin upload flow for UOS docs with:
  - `/admin/login`, `/admin/upload`
  - multi-file upload per category (Execution Engine, Canon, Revenue OS)
  - normalization + archive + state/snapshot/changelog updates
  - admin action logging
- Added persistent buyer cards with timelines under `mission-control/buyer-cards/*`.
- Implemented team auth + role-based Kanban board:
  - `/auth/login`, invite flow, `/board`
  - task CRUD/move/comment APIs
  - board persistence + schema + append-only logs.
- Added governance layer:
  - activity feed/events model
  - review packet state actions and architect-gated approvals
  - task cannot move to Done without approved RP.
- Added UOS dashboard page + restored UOS nav:
  - `/dashboard/uos`
  - upload shortcut button to `/admin/upload`.
- Built Presentation Studio + HTML5 deck engine:
  - template library (sovereign-memo, clean-minimal, blueprint, dark-institutional)
  - prompt-driven generation, mobile deck navigation, thumbnails
  - slide editor v1 (save/rerender/regen image/delete slide).
- Upgraded to pipeline-grade presentation runner v2:
  - `scripts/deck_pipeline_v2.js`
  - stage logging + QA report + SlideSpec-driven deck.json.
- Created skill: `skills/generate-presentation` for repeatable deck generation.

### User Preferences / Operating Constraints Reinforced
- Isaac wants proactive continuous build mode (no waiting for prompts).
- Wants explicit “done” updates when meaningful batches ship.
- Product framing: Capital Alignment Operating System (not CRM), structural-proof tone only.
- Presentation copy constraints: 8th–9th grade readability, no hype language.

### Known Production Issue Window
- Experienced repeated `502 Bad Gateway` due to admin service crashes from JS template-string errors.
- Multiple syntax/escaping fixes applied in `admin-server/src/server.js` and deck scripts.
- Service health became inconsistent during active patching; ongoing stabilization/checks still required.

### Repo / Handoff
- Workspace git remote set to: `https://github.com/ibarnes/sentinel.git`.
- Push may require SSH/token auth setup on EC2 host.
