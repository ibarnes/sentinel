- Project status: Workflow C queue is staged for the next scheduled execution window after intake.
- Scoring policy: no changes today.
- 11:30 UTC: Executed Workflow A (Buyer/Pressure Monitor) via v3_1 runner; output generated under mission-control/workflow-a/out/.
- 12:00 UTC: Ran Workflow B and generated RP-0013 (Top Target Queue). Output limited to 5 accounts due to missing approved Salesforce snapshot; flagged hygiene data gap and recommended export ingestion for full Top-10 scoring.
