  "prompt": "SLIDE 1 Title: Energy and Water Demand Is Rising • West Africa faces power shortages. • Many cities face water stress. • Industry cannot grow without both. • Demand already exists. This is not future demand. It is current reality. ⸻ SLIDE 2 Title: Long-Term Infrastructure Capital Exists • GCC sovereign capital seeks stable, long-term returns. • Power and water assets are familiar investments. • Infrastructure matches long-duration mandates. • Capital is available, but disciplined. Capital is ready. It requires structure. ⸻ SLIDE 3 Title: Projects Stall Before FID Final Investment Decision (FID) often stalls because: • Too many actors are involved. • Currency risk is unclear. • Capital stack is not aligned. • Governance is not defined. • Risk allocation is incomplete. The assets make sense. The structure does not. ⸻ SLIDE 4 Title: A Corridor Platform Approach Instead of separate projects: • One governed corridor platform • Standardized power and water agreements • Defined capital structure • Clear FID boundary • Repeatable governance model Structure replaces fragmentation. ⸻ SLIDE 5 Title: When Governance Is Clear, Capital Moves When structure is defined: • Decision rights are known. • Risk is bounded. • Currency strategy is planned. • Capital can commit safely. • FID becomes signable. The bottleneck is not turbines. It is pre-FID structure. ⸻ SLIDE 6 Title: Alignment with Sovereign Mandates This platform supports: • Energy security • Water security • Regional stability • Cross-border cooperation • Long-term infrastructure ownership This is sovereign-scale work. ⸻ SLIDE 7 Title: Risk Is Reduced Through Structure The corridor model: • Shares risk across actors • Standardizes contracts • Defines dispute pathways • Protects capital before FID • Limits political exposure Clarity lowers uncertainty. ⸻ SLIDE 8 Title: Strategic Positioning Participation at platform level: • Strengthens regional influence • Builds long-term relationships • Anchors infrastructure growth • Aligns capital with sovereign priorities Control comes from structure. ⸻ SLIDE 9 Title: Capital Altitude Is Required This platform requires: • FID-level authority • Strong balance sheets • Long-term perspective • Comfort with multi-actor governance Execution companies cannot anchor this. It requires sovereign-level capital. ⸻ SLIDE 10 Title: Phase 1 — Pre-FID Structuring Before capital commits: • Capital stack is defined • Governance model is locked • Risk allocation is written • Currency plan is structured • FID conditions are documented No construction begins yet. Structure comes first. ⸻ SLIDE 11 Title: Governance Roles Clear separation of roles: • Sovereign capital: Anchor capital and oversight • African sovereigns: Policy and guarantees • Operators: Build and operate assets • Platform architect: Commitment structure only Execution remains external. ⸻ SLIDE 12 Title: Capital Governance & Transparency Layer Purpose: To ensure clarity and alignment across sovereign participants. This layer supports governance. It does not replace legal agreements. It provides: • Digital record of equity ownership • Tracking of capital commitments and releases • Milestone-based activation of distributions • Shared audit visibility across participants It does not: • Replace contracts • Manage operations • Change regulatory authority Structured transparency protects capital alignment. ⸻ SLIDE 13 Title: Capital Sequencing Timeline Structured 90–120 day pre-FID phase: Month 1: • Governance mapping • Capital stack design Month 2: • Risk allocation • Agreement standardization Month 3: • FID boundary confirmation • Commitment readiness Then FID decision. ⸻ SLIDE 14 Title: The Next Gate If aligned, the next step is: • Define a Pre-FID Structuring Mandate • Confirm scope and timeline • Confirm capital authority • Begin commitment architecture",
